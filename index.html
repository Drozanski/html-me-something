                 <p class="para">Art is a big part of my life. Ever since I was 4 years old, art 
                    just stuck with me and came naturally. I'm still learning, and i'm 
                    definetly not the best, but it's one of my ways that I can escape
                    from everything and feel total nirvana. On this page, I'll show you 
                    some of my favorite pieces that i've done and give you a quick 
                    explanation on my inspiration and my feelings when I worked on them!

            <h3 class="head">&quotTangled&quot Drawing</h3>
            <img class="pic" src="https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10696462_10205045288511996_4981108235179612893_n.jpg?oh=df0784f4b3583da8da99d13e8708aba2&oe=5A4E7120"/>
                
                    <p class="para">Out of all Disney movies, &quotTangled&quot is my favorite! Everything from
                        the story, to the voice actor performances, and the animation, I simply love it!
                        I remember sitting in my room, listening to the soundtrack for the movie, and then
                        my sudden urge to draw came out. So, I decided to draw Flynn and Rapunzel together. 
                        I tend to draw a single character, rarely multiples in a piece, but to this day, 
                        I love this drawing solely based on the way they are looking at each other.

            <h3 class="head">Superman Drawing</h3>
            <img class="pic" src="https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/421362_3270363158044_1389085356_n.jpg?oh=5d5ae7f1379c2dc0034322be8ec63ca2&oe=5A4F7051"/>
                
                    <p class="para">Now, this piece is an early one. I think I was a freshmen in High School(2009) when I did this one.
                        It's not an original, I used a photo reference, but Im still proud of it. If I remember correctly, 
                        this drawing took me 3 days to complete. I'm not even much of a Superman fan(go team Batman!), but 
                        when I came across this photo, it just sparked something inside of saying &quotI need to draw this 
                        now!&quote The hardest part were the hands, I still struggle to this day with those damn things!
                    </p>
                

            <h3 class="head">80's Neon Inspired Drawing</h3>
                <img class="pic" src="https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/17917194_10212663967054198_8018441342714963925_o.jpg?oh=fc9cb0ceaab0a74079f1c5ec3aff768b&oe=5A51DA5A"/>
                
                    <p class="para">This drawing is actually pretty recent. I drew this back in May of this year(2017), and it 
                        took me about an hour to finish. Most of my drawing to be honest only take me anywhere from
                        an hour to 6 ours. I have a pretty messy/unfinished style. So with this one, I was Inspired
                        by a movie called &quotKung Fury&quote which is a movie on YouTube that's full of 80' neon and 
                        music. I love the 80's and so I decided to try my hand at some color. I <b>HATE</b> using color
                        since I don't have much practice with it, and I prefer black and white drawings anyways.

            <h3 class="head">Digital Art Attempt</h3>
                <img class="pic" src="https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/18595342_10213013555913701_5321897559270638723_o.jpg?oh=54e6d971442c3e3b2ee5dd317e1e0079&oe=5A53D1A8"/>
                
                    <p class="para">Lastly, this is my attempt at digital art! I've always been intrigued by it and
                        really wanted to see what it was all about. It's a lot harder than I thought it would 
                        be. I'm so used to actually feeling the paper and pencil on each other. This one took me 
                        a day to finish, and I love it. Going back to Disney, &quotThe Goofy Movie&quot and &quotAn Extremely 
                        Goofy Movie&quot were some of my favorites to watch growing up! So that was really my inspiration for This
                        drawing. One thing I do love about digital art though is the rewind feature, so much better than an 
                        actual eraser!
